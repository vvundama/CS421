
#Strings trump integers. Variable takes the form of the value associated with it.
    # Int
    a = 12345

    #Float
    b = 123.456

    #String
    c = "hello"

    #Boolean
    is_coding_fun = TRUE

#Type function
    type(a)
    #This function will tell you what type of data the variable is containing.

#Print function
    print(a, b, c)
    #Prints out the variables

#Multi-variable assignments
    x, y, z = 1 , "world" , 0.0

#Varuables with single/double quotes
    m = "'wassup'"
    # 'wassup' is the string
    n = '"hi"'
    # "hi" is the string

#Input function
    name  = input("Enter your name")
